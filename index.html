                            <p class="text">Bitcoin is the first digital currency. It was invented by a group of software programmers and is completely decentralized, as opposed to paper money (fiat currencies) that are issued and controlled by a country’s central bank. Also, unlike paper currency, Bitcoins cannot be accumulated in any physical form, but rather are credited to their owners through a global online database, called a ledger.</p>

                            <p class="text">Cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is one, are digital assets that can be used as trading commodities. They are decentralized, meaning that instead of being represented as a physical currency, their ‘location’ is denoted in a global online database. At present there are more than 1000 cryptocurrencies in use, including Bitcoin, Auroracoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Peercoin, Zcash, and more. </p>

                                More and more businesses around the world are beginning to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. Many central banks now recognize Bitcoin, enabling official transactions and currency swaps. And the number of exchanges where Bitcoins can be purchased and/or sold is growing. In fact, Bitcoin transactions are easier than credit/debit card transactions, since it does not require merchant accounts and/or payment services. Sides to a transaction simply need a “wallet” – an app that is easily downloaded to your computer or mobile device.

                                A ledger is a book-keeping device for recording and totaling financial/economic exchanges. For digital currencies, a shared (distributed) ledger is a series of online recordings of currency ownership and transactions. These are also being adopted by banks to reduce risk and save expenditure

                                The digital currency environment relies for its existence and orderly conduct upon a chain of blocks. Each block in the chain records transactions. The Blockchain is maintained by a peer-to-peer computer network in which blocks validate one another. However, blockchains may also be used for other records management tasks, such as the medical files and other events-based environments.

                                Forex Trading, or Foreign Exchange trading entails investing in and exchanging currencies.

Forex trading is also one of the most popular venues in online retail investments, as it enables private individuals to participate in global markets for affordable fees and with little training.

                                Investing in Bitcoins on the Forex market entails investing in Forex pairs where Bitcoin is either the main or counter currency. Whereas when buying or selling bitcoins one is obligated to actually purchase Bitcoins (which – at $4200 each – are already quite expensive), in Forex trading, the entry bar is much lower (as low as $5 per trade). Moreover, Forex brokers will usually leverage* your investment, i.e. invest alongside you to increase the value of your investment. And finally, since we are investing in contracts to buy/sell that need never be fulfilled, the investor can invest in the Bitcoin’s losing value (“shorting”) as well as its accruing value (going “long”).
